# Information Gathering

Information gathering, also known as **recognizance** is the phase where we collect data about the target.

There's another term related to information gathering and that is Footprinting:

- **Information gathering**: general intelligence collection (broad, not always technical).
- **Footprinting**: specific network/system mapping (technical, target-oriented).

There are two ways of performing information gathering:

- **Passive**: Collect publicly available data without engaging actively with the target (examples: IP address, DNS information, web technologies used, social media, inspect system from a user perspective).
- **Active**: Actively gather information from the target (examples: port scanning).

> footprinting itself can be either passive or active, depending on how you collect the information.
